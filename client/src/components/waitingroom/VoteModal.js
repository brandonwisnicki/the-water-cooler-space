            There is unrest in the Galactic Senate. Several thousand solar
            systems have declared their intentions to leave the Republic. This
            Separatist movement, under the leadership of the mysterious Count
            Dooku, has made it difficult for the limited number of Jedi Knights
            to maintain peace and order in the galaxy. Senator Amidala, the

            on the critical issue of creating an ARMY OF THE REPUBLIC to assist
            the overwhelmed Jedi....

            It is a dark time for the Rebellion. Although the Death Star has
            been destroyed, Imperial troops have driven the Rebel forces from
            their hidden base and pursued them across the galaxy. Evading the
            dreaded Imperial Starfleet, a group of freedom fighters led by Luke
            Skywalker has established a new secret base on the remote ice world
            of Hoth. The evil lord Darth Vader, obsessed with finding young
            Skywalker, has dispatched thousands of remote probes into the far
            reaches of space.‚Ä¶
